# Median of Stream of Running Integers.

# Asked in Amazon,Flipkart,Google,Microsoft,Hike,Oracle,Walmart

# Difficulty -> Hard

# Median can be defined as the element in the data set which separates the higher half
# and lower half of sample.We can get the median element as, when the input size is odd,
# we take the middle element of sorted data else If the input size is even, we pick average
# of middle two elements in sorted stream.

# Approach : We can use insertion sort as it is an online algorithm i.e it doesn't require
# the whole array at the same time for sorting so we can find median easily with the available
# elements. But this would be inefficient and has a complexity of O(n^2)

# An efficient approach would be to use two heaps, one max heap and min heap. We insert all the
# elements greater than the effective median in the min heap and those less than effective median on
# in the max heap. If the length of max heap is greater than min heap then the top element of max heap
# will be the median and vice versa. If both have same length then we can take the average of root element
# of min and max heap to find the median

# Import heapq library
import heapq

# lists for maintaining min heap and max heap
MinHeap = []
MaxHeap = []

# take input the number of input to give
n = int(input())
# run a loop for each element
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # take each number as input
    data = int(input())

    # if maxheap is empty or the data input is less than the root node
    if not MaxHeap or data < abs(MaxHeap[0]):
        # push the element onto the heap
        # here -data is used as heapq module only provides min heap so we can
        # negate values to implement max heap
        heapq.heappush(MaxHeap, -data)
    else:
        # else push onto the min heap
        heapq.heappush(MinHeap, data)

    # if min heap has more elements as compared to max heap (more than 1)
    if len(MinHeap) - len(MaxHeap) > 1:
        # then balancing is needed so balance the heaps by popping from min heap and negating the data as
        # we are pushing to max heap
        heapq.heappush(MaxHeap, -heapq.heappop(MinHeap))
    # else max heap has more elements
    elif len(MaxHeap) - len(MinHeap) > 1:
        # then balancing is needed so balance the heaps by popping from max heap and negating the data to get
        # back original as we are pushing to min heap
        heapq.heappush(MinHeap, -heapq.heappop(MaxHeap))

    # if both have same number of elements then it is the case of even elements so
    if len(MinHeap) == len(MaxHeap):
        # take the average of root nodes
        print(float(MinHeap[0] - MaxHeap[0]) / 2.0)
    # else if max heap is bigger then return top of max heap but negate as we want original value
    elif len(MinHeap) < len(MaxHeap):
        print(float(-MaxHeap[0]))
    else:
        # else return the top of min heap
        print(float(MinHeap[0]))

# Time Complexity : O(logn) (for pop)
#                   O(n*logn) (for push)
# Space Complexity : O(n)
