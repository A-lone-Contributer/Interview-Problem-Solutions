# Return a new sorted merged list from K sorted lists, each with size N

# Asked in Amazon,Flipkart and many more.

# Difficulty -> Medium

# Approach:
# There can be a lot of ways to approach this problem.An intuitive approach
# would be to copy the elements into a N*K size array and then sort(using any O(N*log(N)) algorithm) the
# resultant array which will take O(NK*log(NK))

# Another approach (for smaller arrays) would be to compare the elements in every array like we do in
# classic merge-sort and get a resultant sorted array at the end. This would take O(NK*K) time

# A efficient solution is to first merge arrays into groups of 2. After first merging, we have K/2 arrays.
# We again merge arrays in groups, now we have K/4 arrays. We keep doing it unit we have one array left.
# The time complexity of this solution would O(NK*log(K))

# Another efficient solution is to use Min Heap. It has same time complexity which is O(NK*log(K))
# but for different sized arrays, this solution works much better.


# importing heap library

def kmerge(lists):

    # result list with size N*K
    final_merged_list = []

    # Initialising the heap.
    # (One for the index for which list among the list of lists the element lives,
    # one for the element index which is where the element lives, and the value of the element).
    # Since we want the key of the heap to be based on the value of the element, we should put that first in the tuple.
    heap = [(given_lists[0], i, 0) for i, given_lists in enumerate(lists) if given_lists]

    # heapify the heap so that we have access to the smallest element as the root node.
    # to skip this we can use priority queue implementation where elements are sorted as soon as
    # they are inserted (uses a comparator)
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    # As long as there are elements in heap
    while heap:
    
        # pop the root (minimum element) from the heap

        # append the recently popped element to out result list
        final_merged_list.append(value)

        # This if condition checks whether the list is exhausted. If element index is less than list index
        # there will be elements so as long as there are elements push the tuple onto heap.
