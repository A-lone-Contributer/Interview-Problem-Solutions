# Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the
# new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

# This problem was asked by Uber --> (Medium)

# To solve this problem we can calculate the product of left side and right side in separate array and 
# multiply their respective elements into a new resultant array but this will take lot extra space 
# We can do this efficiently with only one array doing both left and right product inplace 

def mularray(arr, n):
    i, temp = 1, 1

    # Allocate memory for the product array
    prod = [1] * n

    # Initialize the product array as 1

    # In this loop, temp variable contains product of
    # elements on left side excluding arr[i]
    for i in range(n):
        prod[i] = temp
        temp *= arr[i]

    # Reinitialize temp to 1 for product on right side
    temp = 1

    # In this loop, we calculate  product of
    # elements on right side excluding arr[i]
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        prod[i] *= temp
        temp *= arr[i]

    # Print the constructed array
    for i in range(n):
        print(prod[i], end=" ")

# Test Case 1
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
n = len(arr)

#  Test Case 2

# Time Complexity -> O(n)
#  Space Complexity -> O(n)
