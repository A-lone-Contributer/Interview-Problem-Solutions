# To sort the array in decreasing order of frequency.


# Approach :
# This can be done by maintaining a hashmap and storing the array
# elements as keys and the count as corresponding values.

# Difficulty -> Medium

        # by 1
        if item in hash_map:

        # if not present then initialise the hashmap with (element,count) pair
