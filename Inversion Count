# For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted.
# If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order
# that inversion count is the maximum.
# Formally, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j.

# There can be a lot of approaches to solve this problem. A Naive approach would be to
# loop through the entire array checking whether the current element is greater than the other elements
# which is the condition for inversion. This would take O(n^2) time.

# An efficient approach would be to use merge sort technique which is a divide and conquer paradigm.
# We can simply divide the array and merge it back checking the inversion condition for each left and right
# sub-array. The total number of inversions will be the inversions encountered in left half , right half and
# in tbe merge step.This would run in O(n*log(n)) time. But there are more better methods out there such as using
# Fenwick trees.
